# Contributing to NR AI Coding Observability: Preflight

This guide covers everything you need to get productive in this repo: environment setup, project architecture, code conventions, testing, and how to verify your changes end-to-end.

---

## What Is This Project?

Preflight provides **observability for AI coding assistants**. When developers use tools like Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or Copilot, this project captures what's happening — tool calls, token usage, costs, efficiency patterns — and sends it all to New Relic.

**MCP Server (this repo)** — Hooks into Claude Code via the Model Context Protocol. Captures every tool call, computes metrics like efficiency scores and anti-pattern detection, and exposes MCP tools that Claude Code can query directly.

The MCP server uses a common transport layer (`src/shared/`) for event buffering, metric aggregation, and HTTP delivery to New Relic's APIs.

---

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v22 or later (v24 recommended; use `nvm install` to get the version from `.nvmrc`)
- A New Relic account with a license key and account ID (for cloud-path testing)

### First-time setup

```bash
nvm install        # Install the right Node version (v24, from .nvmrc)
nvm use            # Activate it
npm install        # Install dependencies
npm run build      # Build TypeScript and chmod +x the CLI binaries
npm link           # Register preflight on PATH (required for Claude Code hooks)
npm test           # Verify everything works
```

To pull the latest changes and rebuild later:

```bash
preflight update
```

To run a single test file:

```bash
npx jest -- src/metrics/cost-tracker.test.ts
npx jest -- src/shared/harvest/harvest-scheduler.test.ts
```

To build directly without the chmod step:

```bash
npx tsc -b .
```

### Working with shared code

Do not edit `src/shared/` directly — it is a vendored snapshot. If you find a bug there, please open an issue at https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/preflight/issues.

### Shared transport layer (`src/shared/`)

The foundation layer is vendored in `src/shared/`. Provides:

- **Event creation** — `createAiRequest()`, `createAiResponse()`, serialization to NR format
- **Transport** — HTTP clients for New Relic's Events, Metric, and Logs APIs, plus an OTLP/HTTP exporter
- **Harvest scheduler** — Periodic flush of buffered events (5s) and metrics (60s) with bounded retry buffers
- **Token utilities** — Extract token counts from Anthropic/Gemini API responses
- **Pricing** — Calculate USD cost from token counts using model-specific pricing tables
- **Logger** — `createLogger('name')` writes structured JSON to stderr

### MCP server subsystems

- **Hooks** (`src/hooks/`) — Claude Code invokes a hook script on every tool use. The collector writes events to a local JSONL buffer. The event processor drains the buffer, pairs pre/post events, and emits `ToolCallRecord` objects.

- **Metrics** (`src/metrics/`) — metric analyzers that each receive tool call records and maintain running state. Session tracking, cost tracking + forecasting, task detection, anti-pattern detection, efficiency scoring, trend analysis, collaboration profiling, and more.

- **Tools** (`src/tools/`) — MCP tool handlers that query the metric trackers and return results. Registered via `registerTools()` in `src/tools/session-stats.ts`.

- **Proxy** (`src/proxy/`) — HTTP proxy layer that forwards requests to upstream MCP servers while recording latency and tool call metrics.

- **Storage** (`src/storage/`) — Local file persistence for session summaries and weekly aggregations under `~/.newrelic-preflight/`.

- **Security** (`src/security/`) — Audit trail that classifies tool calls and flags sensitive file access or destructive commands; SSRF validation for outbound URLs.

- **Tracing** (`src/tracing/`) — OTel span management. Emits a session root span, intermediate task spans from `TaskDetector` boundaries, and a leaf span per `ToolCallRecord`.

---

## Key Concepts

### ToolCallRecord

The central data type. Every tool call captured by the hooks becomes a `ToolCallRecord` with fields like `toolName`, `durationMs`, `success`, `filePath`, `command`, `exitCode`, etc. This record flows through all metric trackers.

### HarvestScheduler

Events and metrics are buffered in memory and flushed to New Relic on a timer. Events flush every 5 seconds, metrics every 60 seconds. Failed batches are re-queued with a bounded retry buffer. The scheduler handles graceful shutdown by awaiting a final flush.

### Metric Trackers

All trackers follow the same pattern:

```typescript
tracker.recordToolCall(record); // feed data in
tracker.getMetrics(); // read state out
tracker.reset(sessionId); // clear for new session
```

Each tracker has a corresponding test file with factory helpers.

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

The server communicates with Claude Code over stdio using JSON-RPC. It registers tools that Claude Code can discover and invoke. The `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` package handles the protocol; our code registers tool handlers and implements the business logic.

---

## Code Conventions

### TypeScript

- ESM modules with `.js` import extensions (required for NodeNext resolution)
- Strict mode enabled
- `readonly` on all interface fields
- `interface` for API contracts, `type` for unions and local aliases
- Never use `as any` — use `as unknown as T` for forced coercions
- Never add `eslint-disable` comments — fix the underlying issue

### File organization

- One module per file, co-located tests: `foo.ts` + `foo.test.ts`
- Files: `kebab-case` naming
- Classes: `PascalCase`, functions: `camelCase`, constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`

### Import order

1. Node.js builtins (`node:fs`, `node:path`)
2. External packages (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `zod`)
3. _(blank line)_
4. Shared imports (`../shared/index.js`)
5. Local imports (`./types.js`)

### Logging

Every module creates a scoped logger:

```typescript
import { createLogger } from '../shared/index.js';
const logger = createLogger('my-module');
```

Logger writes to **stderr** as JSON. Never write to stdout — it's reserved for the MCP stdio transport.

### Error handling

- Failed network sends re-queue batches for retry (bounded buffer)
- Graceful degradation: if a tracker is unavailable, tools return sensible defaults
- `try/catch` around file I/O operations with logger warnings
- Clock skew protection: `Math.max(0, ...)` on computed durations

---

## Testing

Tests live next to the code they test (`foo.test.ts` alongside `foo.ts`).

### Writing tests

```typescript
let stderrSpy: ReturnType<typeof jest.spyOn>;

beforeEach(() => {
  stderrSpy = jest.spyOn(process.stderr, 'write').mockImplementation(() => true);
});

afterEach(() => {
  stderrSpy.mockRestore();
});

function makeRecord(overrides?: Partial<ToolCallRecord>): ToolCallRecord {
  return { id: 'rec-001', toolName: 'Read', /* sensible defaults */ ...overrides };
}
```

- Suppress logger output by mocking `process.stderr.write`
- Use `make*` factory functions with optional `Partial<T>` overrides
- Use `jest.useFakeTimers()` for anything time-dependent
- Create temp directories for storage tests, clean up in `afterEach`

See [TEST_PATTERNS.md](./docs/TEST_PATTERNS.md) for the full testing guide.

## Security

This codebase sends telemetry to New Relic and can spawn child processes and proxy network requests:

- **Redact before you log or send.** Any string that might contain secrets must pass through `redact()` (agent) or `redactSensitive()` (MCP server) before it reaches a logger or NR event.
- **Validate external strings at the boundary.** `accountId` is validated as 1–12 decimal digits at config load. Tool names are truncated and stripped of control characters.
- **Subprocess commands need absolute paths.** `StdioUpstream` rejects relative command names and strips dangerous env vars (`LD_PRELOAD`, etc.) before spawning.
- **HTTP upstream URLs are SSRF-checked.** `HttpUpstream` rejects non-`http:`/`https:` schemes and RFC-1918/loopback hosts.
- **High security mode is absolute.** When `highSecurity=true`, `recordContent` is always `false`. Never bypass this.

See [SECURITY.md](./docs/SECURITY.md) for the full guidelines and code review checklist.

## Platform Support

The MCP server automatically detects and supports multiple AI coding platforms:

| Platform           | Setup                                     | Notes                                                  |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Claude Code**    | Built-in                                  | Default platform; install hook via `preflight install` |
| **Cursor**         | Env var: `NEW_RELIC_AI_PLATFORM=cursor`   | Auto-detected if Cursor config present                 |
| **Windsurf**       | Env var: `NEW_RELIC_AI_PLATFORM=windsurf` | Auto-detected if Windsurf config present               |

## Deploying to New Relic

### Dashboards

```bash
NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=NRAK-... NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=12345 preflight deploy-dashboards --all
```

Deploys all seven pre-built dashboards. Use `--print` to output JSON for manual import via the NR UI.

For a self-reflection dashboard pre-filtered to your identity:

```bash
NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=NRAK-... NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=12345 \
  preflight deploy-dashboards ai-coding-assistant-personal.json --developer <your-name>
```

To replace existing dashboards in place (preserves GUID and URL), add `--update`:

```bash
NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=NRAK-... NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=12345 \
  preflight deploy-dashboards --all --update
```

To remove all deployed dashboards:

```bash
NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=NRAK-... NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=12345 \
  preflight deploy-dashboards --all --teardown
```

### Alert conditions

```bash
NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=NRAK-... NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=12345 preflight deploy-alerts
```

Deploys the "AI Coding Assistant Alerts" policy with five NRQL conditions. Use `--dry-run` to preview without hitting the API.

To sync conditions in place on an existing policy (preserves policy ID; matches conditions by name to update, creates new ones, deletes removed ones):

```bash
NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=NRAK-... NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=12345 preflight deploy-alerts --update
```

For per-developer alerts scoped to one identity:

```bash
NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=NRAK-... NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=12345 \
  preflight deploy-alerts --developer <your-name>
```

This creates a separate policy `AI Coding — Personal — <name>` from `alerts/conditions-personal/`, with `developer = '<name>'` injected into every NRQL query. Use `--teardown --developer <name>` to remove just the personal policy.

To remove all deployed alert conditions:

```bash
NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=NRAK-... NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=12345 preflight deploy-alerts --teardown
```

### Terraform (IaC alternative)

A Terraform module in `terraform/` deploys all 7 dashboards and all 10 alert conditions as an alternative to the scripts above. See [ADVANCED.md — Terraform Deployment](./docs/ADVANCED.md#terraform-deployment) for full usage, variables.

## Verifying Your Setup

After making changes, run through these checkpoints to confirm end-to-end behavior. Work through one path (cloud or local) at a time.

### Prerequisites

| Item                                                                     | Check                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Node.js v22+                                                             | `node --version` → `v22.x.x` or later |
| npm v10+                                                                 | `npm --version` → `10.x.x`            |
| Claude Code (latest)                                                     | Opens and launches                    |
| **Cloud path only:** New Relic account with a license key + user API key | See README                            |

### 1. Build and link

```bash
git clone https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/preflight
cd preflight
nvm use
npm install
npm run build
npm link
```

**Checkpoint:** `preflight --help` prints the command list. If you see `command not found`, the `npm link` step didn't work.

### 2. Run the setup wizard

```bash
preflight setup
```

For cloud path, choose `cloud` and supply your license key, account ID, and (optionally) your user API key. For local path, choose `local`.

**Checkpoint:** `cat ~/.newrelic-preflight/config.json` shows the values you entered.

### 3. Restart Claude Code

Quit and reopen Claude Code. The MCP server starts automatically.

**Checkpoint — MCP connection:** In a new Claude Code session, ask:

> _Call `nr_observe_health` and show me the result._

Expected:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "version": "1.x.x",
  "developer": "your-name",
  "session_id": "some-uuid",
  "uptime_seconds": 3
}
```

If you see `tool not found` or `MCP server unavailable`, the server didn't start. Check Claude Code's MCP output panel (View → Output → MCP) for errors, then re-run `preflight install` and restart.

**Checkpoint — local dashboard (local path only):**

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:7777/api/health
# Expected: {"ok":true,"uptime":<number>}
```

### 4. Generate activity and verify

In Claude Code:

> _Read the file README.md and summarize it in one sentence._

Then:

> _Call `nr_observe_get_session_stats` and show me the result._

Expected: `tool_calls` > 0, non-zero `session_duration_ms`.

**Cloud path:** Open your NR account → Dashboards → search "AI Coding". Within 1–2 minutes:

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM AiToolCall WHERE developer = 'your-name' SINCE 5 minutes ago
```

Expected: a non-zero count.

**Local path:** Open `http://127.0.0.1:7777` and confirm the Today tab shows tool call count > 0.

### 5. Smoke test anti-pattern detection

> _Read README.md. Read it again. Read it a third time. Now call `nr_observe_get_anti_patterns`._

Expected: a `re_reading` entry for `README.md` with `read_count: 3`.

### Deploy dashboards and alerts (cloud path)

```bash
# Dashboards
NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=NRAK-... NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=12345 \
  preflight deploy-dashboards --all

# Alerts (optional)
NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=NRAK-... NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=12345 \
  preflight deploy-alerts
```

> Re-deploying? Use `--update` to sync in place and avoid creating duplicates.

**Checkpoint:** Open NR → Dashboards → search `AI Coding`. You should see 7 dashboards listed.

### Teardown / reset

To remove all hooks and start fresh:

```bash
preflight uninstall
rm -rf ~/.newrelic-preflight

# Cloud: remove dashboards and alerts from NR
NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=NRAK-... NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=12345 \
  preflight deploy-dashboards --all --teardown
NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=NRAK-... NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=12345 \
  preflight deploy-alerts --teardown
```

Then restart Claude Code.
