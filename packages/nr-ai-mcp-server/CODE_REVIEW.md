# Code Review: nr-ai-mcp-server

**Date:** 2026-04-20
**Scope:** Full source review of `packages/nr-ai-mcp-server/src/`
**Focus:** Real bugs affecting correctness, data integrity, and reliability

---

## Critical / High Severity

### ✅ 1. Data loss in log ingestion on send failure

**File:** `src/transport/log-ingest.ts:121-142`

The `flush()` method clears the buffer (line 124-125) BEFORE attempting to send. If `sendLogsFn()` fails or throws, the logs are permanently dropped with only a warning logged.

```typescript
const batch = this.buffer;
this.buffer = [];          // ← buffer cleared
const result = await this.sendLogsFn(batch, ...); // ← then this fails
// batch is gone forever
```

**Impact:** Security audit trail events and log data can be silently lost on any transient network failure. No retry, no persistent queue.

**Fix:** Re-add the batch to the buffer on failure, or use a persistent queue with retry.

---

### ✅ 2. Data loss in buffer drain on read/unlink failure

**File:** `src/storage/local-store.ts:62-98`

The `drainBuffer()` method renames the buffer file to `.drain` (line 70), then attempts to read and delete it. If `readFileSync()` or `unlinkSync()` fails inside the try block, the catch at line 94 returns `[]`, abandoning the `.drain` file with all its events permanently unprocessed.

**Impact:** Hook events (tool call records) can be lost if a file read error occurs after the rename. The `.drain` file is orphaned on disk with no recovery path.

**Fix:** On failure, rename `.drain` back to the original buffer path, or implement a retry on next poll.

---

### ✅ 3. bashExitCodes map is never populated

**File:** `src/metrics/session-tracker.ts:105, 113-175`

The `bashExitCodes` map is initialized (line 105) and exposed in the stats output (line 200-203), but `recordToolCall()` never writes exit codes to it — even though `ToolCallRecord` has an `exitCode` field.

**Impact:** The `bashExitCodes` field in session stats is always an empty object. Users lose visibility into command success/failure distributions.

**Fix:** Add `if (tool === 'Bash' && record.exitCode != null) { this.bashExitCodes.set(record.exitCode, (this.bashExitCodes.get(record.exitCode) ?? 0) + 1); }` in the Bash tracking block.

---

### ✅ 4. Cross-session tools all advertised regardless of individual dependencies

**File:** `src/tools/session-stats.ts:217-223`

The `hasCrossSession` check uses `||` across all cross-session dependencies. If ANY single dependency exists, ALL 7 cross-session tools are listed. Individual handlers guard with `if (!dep) break;`, so they won't crash — but tools appear available to clients when they actually can't execute.

**Impact:** MCP clients (Claude Code) see tools like `nr_observe_get_cost_per_outcome` listed but get empty/error responses when required dependencies are missing. Confusing UX.

**Fix:** Register each cross-session tool individually based on its specific dependencies.

---

## Medium Severity

### ✅ 5. Anti-pattern: editStreaks.clear() resets ALL files on any verification

**File:** `src/metrics/anti-patterns.ts:247-253`

When a verification command (test/build/lint) is detected, ALL edit streaks across ALL files are cleared. A test targeting File B resets the blind-editing streak for unrelated File A.

**Impact:** False negatives in blind editing detection. Developers editing one file without verification but testing another file will not be flagged.

**Fix:** Track which files are likely being tested (or only reset streaks for files that were recently read/verified), rather than clearing the entire map.

---

### ✅ 6. No timeout on upstream HTTP proxy requests

**File:** `src/proxy/upstream-http.ts:81-189`

The HTTP request to upstream MCP servers has no timeout. A hanging upstream will block the proxy response indefinitely and accumulate stuck connections.

**Impact:** A single slow/unresponsive upstream server can exhaust proxy resources and cause cascading timeouts for all MCP tool calls.

**Fix:** Add a configurable timeout (e.g., 30s default) via `req.setTimeout()` or `AbortController`.

---

### ✅ 7. Incomplete response on upstream error mid-stream

**File:** `src/proxy/upstream-http.ts:136-162`

If the upstream connection errors after some response chunks have arrived, `res.end()` is called (line 154) without the accumulated data. The response size is recorded as 0 (line 158), but some data may have already been implicitly flushed to the client.

**Impact:** Clients may receive truncated responses. Metrics record 0 bytes even though partial data was sent.

**Fix:** Track whether headers/data have already been sent to the client. If mid-stream, destroy the socket to signal error instead of sending a clean `end()`.

---

### ✅ 8. cost_per_outcome handler ignores `since` and `developer` filters

**File:** `src/tools/cross-session-tools.ts:320-323`

The `handleGetCostPerOutcome` handler accepts `since` and `developer` parameters but `taskDetector.getCompletedTasks()` returns ALL tasks unfiltered. The filter parameters are accepted but never applied.

**Impact:** Users cannot filter cost-per-outcome data by time range or developer — they always get all data regardless of what they request.

**Fix:** Filter completed tasks by `since` timestamp and developer before passing to `attributeCosts()`.

---

### ✅ 9. Session gauge timer can fire after scheduler is stopped

**File:** `src/transport/nr-ingest.ts:307-324`

The session gauge interval (with `.unref()`) can fire its callback after `stop()` has been called but before the interval is cleared, attempting to record metrics on a stopped scheduler.

**Impact:** Final session metrics (duration, file counts) at shutdown may be lost silently.

**Fix:** Guard `emitSessionGauges()` with `if (!this.running) return;` at the top.

---

### ✅ 10. Collaboration profile autonomy fallback is inconsistent

**File:** `src/metrics/collaboration-profile.ts:222-225`

When `userMessages === 0`, autonomy returns 0.8 (implying high autonomy). But zero messages means "no data" not "high autonomy." Other fallbacks in the codebase use 0.5 as neutral.

**Impact:** Developers with very few messages (e.g., short sessions, automated runs) get artificially high autonomy scores, skewing team baselines and comparisons.

**Fix:** Return 0.5 (neutral) when insufficient data exists, consistent with other components.

---

## Low Severity

### ✅ 11. proxy-metrics.ts unsafe split with non-null assertion

**File:** `src/metrics/proxy-metrics.ts:197-198, 240-241`

`key.split('|')` is destructured with `!` assertions. If a malformed key contains no `|`, the server name will be `undefined` (cast away by `!`), producing metrics with empty attributes.

**Impact:** Corrupted metric attributes if key format is violated. Unlikely in practice since keys are internally constructed.

---

### ✅ 12. No runtime validation on feedback quality enum

**File:** `src/tools/workflow-tools.ts:290-298`

The `quality` field is typed as `'good' | 'bad' | 'neutral'` but the handler casts with `as unknown as` without runtime validation. Invalid values are stored as-is.

**Impact:** Corrupted feedback data if a client sends non-enum values. Low risk since MCP schema validation usually catches this upstream.

---

---

## Recommendation

**Before sharing:** Fix items 1-3 (data loss bugs) — these are the ones that would embarrass in a demo or undermine trust in the tool's data. Item 4 is cosmetic but visible to users.

Items 5-10 are real but unlikely to cause visible issues in a demo context. They should be addressed before any production use.

---

## Implementation Plans

### ✅ Fix #1: Re-queue logs on send failure

**File:** `src/transport/log-ingest.ts`

The buffer swap on line 124-125 is correct for preventing duplicate sends during concurrent flushes — we should keep that pattern. The fix is to re-prepend the batch on failure so the next flush retries them. Add a cap to prevent unbounded growth if the endpoint is permanently down.

Add a class field:

```typescript
private readonly maxBufferSize = 1_000;
```

Replace the `flush()` method body (lines 121-142):

```typescript
async flush(): Promise<void> {
  if (this.buffer.length === 0) return;

  const batch = this.buffer;
  this.buffer = [];

  try {
    const result = await this.sendLogsFn(batch, this.licenseKey, this.transportOptions);
    if (!result.success) {
      logger.warn('Failed to send logs — re-queuing batch for retry', {
        batchSize: batch.length,
        error: result.error,
      });
      this.requeueBatch(batch);
    }
  } catch (err) {
    const message = err instanceof Error ? err.message : String(err);
    logger.warn('Unexpected error sending logs — re-queuing batch for retry', {
      batchSize: batch.length,
      error: message,
    });
    this.requeueBatch(batch);
  }
}

private requeueBatch(batch: NrLogEntry[]): void {
  // Prepend failed batch so it retries first; cap to prevent unbounded growth
  this.buffer = [...batch, ...this.buffer];
  if (this.buffer.length > this.maxBufferSize) {
    const dropped = this.buffer.length - this.maxBufferSize;
    this.buffer = this.buffer.slice(0, this.maxBufferSize);
    logger.warn('Log buffer overflow — oldest entries dropped', { dropped });
  }
}
```

**Tests to add** (`src/transport/log-ingest.test.ts`):

1. `flush() re-queues batch when sendLogsFn returns failure` — mock sendLogsFn to return `{ success: false }`, call `flush()`, verify buffer still contains the entries, then mock success and flush again to verify retry works.
2. `flush() re-queues batch when sendLogsFn throws` — same pattern with a thrown error.
3. `buffer overflow drops oldest entries` — fill buffer beyond maxBufferSize, verify it caps correctly.

---

### ✅ Fix #2: Recover orphaned .drain file on read failure

**File:** `src/storage/local-store.ts`

The issue is in the inner try/catch block (lines 76-97). If `readFileSync` or `unlinkSync` throws, the `.drain` file is left on disk and never retried. Two changes needed:

**Change A:** At the start of `drainBuffer()`, check for an existing `.drain` file and recover it. This handles both crash recovery and the read-failure case.

Add before the `existsSync(this.bufferPath)` check (line 63):

```typescript
const tmpPath = this.bufferPath + '.drain';

// Recover from a previous failed drain — the .drain file has events that
// were never processed.  Rename it back so it's picked up in this drain.
if (existsSync(tmpPath)) {
  try {
    if (existsSync(this.bufferPath)) {
      // Both files exist (crash during drain while hook was writing).
      // Prepend .drain contents to the buffer so nothing is lost.
      const drainData = readFileSync(tmpPath, 'utf-8');
      const bufferData = readFileSync(this.bufferPath, 'utf-8');
      writeFileSync(this.bufferPath, drainData + bufferData);
      unlinkSync(tmpPath);
    } else {
      renameSync(tmpPath, this.bufferPath);
    }
  } catch {
    logger.warn('Failed to recover .drain file — will retry next poll');
  }
}
```

**Change B:** Remove the now-redundant `const tmpPath` declaration on line 67 (it's declared earlier).

This approach is safe because:
- If only `.drain` exists: simple rename back — same as before, but now we retry.
- If both exist: merge them (`.drain` first since it's older data), then continue the normal drain flow.
- If recovery itself fails: log and try again next poll interval.

**Tests to add** (`src/storage/local-store.test.ts`):

1. `drainBuffer() recovers orphaned .drain file` — create a `.drain` file with valid events, call `drainBuffer()`, verify events are returned.
2. `drainBuffer() merges .drain and buffer when both exist` — create both files, verify all events from both are returned in order.
3. `drainBuffer() handles corrupt .drain file gracefully` — create a `.drain` with invalid data, verify it doesn't crash and skips malformed lines.

---

### ✅ Fix #3: Populate bashExitCodes in session tracker

**File:** `src/metrics/session-tracker.ts`

The Bash tracking block at lines 158-160 only increments `bashCommandsRun`. The `exitCode` field exists on `ToolCallRecord` (it's an index-signature `[key: string]: unknown` property set by the hook parser) and is used elsewhere (e.g., `workflow-tools.ts:172`), but never recorded into the `bashExitCodes` map.

Expand the Bash tracking block (lines 158-160) from:

```typescript
if (tool === 'Bash') {
  this.bashCommandsRun++;
}
```

To:

```typescript
if (tool === 'Bash') {
  this.bashCommandsRun++;
  const exitCode = record.exitCode as number | undefined;
  if (exitCode != null) {
    this.bashExitCodes.set(exitCode, (this.bashExitCodes.get(exitCode) ?? 0) + 1);
  }
}
```

This is safe because:
- `exitCode` comes from the hook parser via the `[key: string]: unknown` index signature, so the cast to `number | undefined` is correct.
- The `!= null` check covers both `undefined` (field not present) and `null` (explicitly null).
- Zero is a valid exit code (success) and will be tracked correctly since `!= null` allows 0 through.

**Tests to add** (`src/metrics/session-tracker.test.ts`):

1. `recordToolCall populates bashExitCodes for Bash commands with exit codes` — record several Bash calls with exit codes 0, 0, 1, 127. Verify `getMetrics().bashExitCodes` is `{ 0: 2, 1: 1, 127: 1 }`.
2. `recordToolCall ignores exit codes for non-Bash tools` — record an Edit call with an `exitCode` field. Verify `bashExitCodes` remains empty.
3. `recordToolCall handles Bash commands without exit codes` — record a Bash call with no `exitCode` field. Verify `bashExitCodes` remains empty and `bashCommandsRun` still increments.

### ✅ Fix #4: Register cross-session tools individually based on their specific dependencies

**File:** `src/tools/session-stats.ts`

The current code (lines 217-223) uses a single `||`-chain across all cross-session dependencies and registers all 8 tools if _any_ dependency exists. Each tool's dispatch handler has its own guard (`if (!dep) break;`), so they won't crash — but MCP clients see tools listed that they can't actually execute, producing confusing empty responses.

Replace lines 216-223:

```typescript
// Cross-session tools (registered when their dependencies are available)
const hasCrossSession =
  sessionStore || weeklySummaryGenerator || trendAnalyzer ||
  collaborationProfiler || claudeMdTracker || costPerOutcomeAnalyzer ||
  recommendationEngine;
if (hasCrossSession) {
  tools.push(...CROSS_SESSION_TOOLS);
}
```

With individual registrations:

```typescript
// Cross-session tools — each registered only when its specific dependencies exist
if (sessionStore) {
  tools.push(SESSION_HISTORY_TOOL, PLATFORM_COMPARISON_TOOL);
}
if (weeklySummaryGenerator) {
  tools.push(WEEKLY_SUMMARY_TOOL);
}
if (trendAnalyzer) {
  tools.push(TRENDS_TOOL);
}
if (collaborationProfiler) {
  tools.push(COLLABORATION_PROFILE_TOOL);
}
if (claudeMdTracker) {
  tools.push(CLAUDEMD_IMPACT_TOOL);
}
if (costPerOutcomeAnalyzer && taskDetector) {
  tools.push(COST_PER_OUTCOME_TOOL);
}
if (recommendationEngine) {
  tools.push(RECOMMENDATIONS_TOOL);
}
```

This requires updating the imports from `cross-session-tools.ts`. Currently line 43 imports the grouped array:

```typescript
CROSS_SESSION_TOOLS,
```

Replace with the individual constants:

```typescript
SESSION_HISTORY_TOOL,
WEEKLY_SUMMARY_TOOL,
TRENDS_TOOL,
COLLABORATION_PROFILE_TOOL,
CLAUDEMD_IMPACT_TOOL,
COST_PER_OUTCOME_TOOL,
RECOMMENDATIONS_TOOL,
PLATFORM_COMPARISON_TOOL,
```

The `CROSS_SESSION_TOOLS` array export in `cross-session-tools.ts` can remain for backward compatibility — it's just no longer used in registration.

**Dependency mapping** (derived from each handler's dispatch guard):

| Tool | Required dependency |
|------|-------------------|
| `SESSION_HISTORY_TOOL` | `sessionStore` |
| `WEEKLY_SUMMARY_TOOL` | `weeklySummaryGenerator` |
| `TRENDS_TOOL` | `trendAnalyzer` |
| `COLLABORATION_PROFILE_TOOL` | `collaborationProfiler` |
| `CLAUDEMD_IMPACT_TOOL` | `claudeMdTracker` |
| `COST_PER_OUTCOME_TOOL` | `costPerOutcomeAnalyzer` AND `taskDetector` |
| `RECOMMENDATIONS_TOOL` | `recommendationEngine` |
| `PLATFORM_COMPARISON_TOOL` | `sessionStore` |

**Tests to add** (`src/tools/session-stats.test.ts`):

1. `registerTools with only sessionStore lists only session_history and platform_comparison tools` — create a mock Server, register with only `sessionStore`, verify `ListToolsRequest` returns exactly those 2 cross-session tools.
2. `registerTools with all deps lists all cross-session tools` — register with all dependencies provided, verify all 8 cross-session tools appear.
3. `registerTools with no cross-session deps lists no cross-session tools` — register with only `sessionTracker`, verify no cross-session tool names appear in the list.

### ✅ Fix #5: Reset only relevant edit streaks on verification commands

**File:** `src/metrics/anti-patterns.ts`

In `detectBlindEditing()` (line 252), when a verification command (test/build/lint) is detected, `editStreaks.clear()` wipes all per-file streak counters. This means a test targeting File B resets the blind-editing streak for an unrelated File A, producing false negatives.

The challenge: we can't reliably determine which files a test command covers. However, we can improve the heuristic by only resetting streaks for files that were **read** between the last edit and the verification command. If a file was read, it's likely being validated. If it wasn't read, the developer is probably editing it blind.

A simpler and more correct approach: instead of tracking which files tests cover, track the **last read set** and only reset streaks for files in that set.

Replace lines 247-253:

```typescript
} else if (
  call.toolName === 'Bash' &&
  (call.isTestCommand || call.isBuildCommand || call.isLintCommand)
) {
  // Verification command resets all edit streaks
  editStreaks.clear();
}
```

With:

```typescript
} else if (call.toolName === 'Read') {
  // Reading a file counts as partial verification — reset its edit streak
  const file = call.filePath as string | undefined;
  if (file) {
    editStreaks.delete(file);
  }
} else if (
  call.toolName === 'Bash' &&
  (call.isTestCommand || call.isBuildCommand || call.isLintCommand)
) {
  // Verification command (test/build/lint) resets all remaining edit streaks.
  // Files that were read since last edit are already cleared above,
  // but a build/test that passes validates the whole project.
  editStreaks.clear();
}
```

Wait — this still clears all on a test command. The real improvement is to make Read count as verification for individual files, which is the more impactful change. A test/build **does** validate the whole project, so clearing all on those is actually defensible.

However, the original bug report is about tests targeting File B resetting File A. The better fix: only clear streaks for files that the _test output_ mentions, but that's not reliably available. The pragmatic fix is:

Replace the `editStreaks.clear()` block (lines 247-253) with:

```typescript
} else if (call.toolName === 'Read') {
  // Reading a file is a form of verification — reset its streak
  const file = call.filePath as string | undefined;
  if (file) {
    editStreaks.delete(file);
  }
} else if (
  call.toolName === 'Bash' &&
  (call.isTestCommand || call.isBuildCommand || call.isLintCommand)
) {
  // A passing verification command validates all edits
  if (call.success) {
    editStreaks.clear();
  }
  // A failing test/build does NOT clear streaks — the edits still need verification
}
```

This improves detection in two ways:
1. **Read as verification**: reading a file resets its streak, which is the most common "verification" pattern (read file → edit file → read to check).
2. **Failed tests don't clear streaks**: if a test fails, the edits are not validated. Only passing verification resets the counters.

**Tests to add** (`src/metrics/anti-patterns.test.ts`):

1. `blind_editing: Read resets streak for specific file` — Edit A 4 times, Read A, Edit A once more. Should NOT flag A (streak reset by the Read). Edit B 4 times without reading B. Should flag B.
2. `blind_editing: passing test clears all streaks` — Edit A and B 4 times each, then run a passing test. Neither should be flagged.
3. `blind_editing: failing test does NOT clear streaks` — Edit A 4 times, then run a failing test. A should still be flagged.

---

### ✅ Fix #6: Add configurable timeout on upstream HTTP proxy requests

**File:** `src/proxy/upstream-http.ts`

The `forward()` method (lines 81-189) creates an HTTP request with no timeout. A hanging upstream will block indefinitely, accumulating stuck connections. Since MCP tool calls go through this proxy, a single slow upstream can stall the entire tool pipeline.

**Step 1:** Add a `timeoutMs` field to the class. Default to 30 seconds.

Add a class field after line 43:

```typescript
private readonly timeoutMs: number;
```

In the constructor (line 45), read from config with a default:

```typescript
this.timeoutMs = config.timeoutMs ?? 30_000;
```

This requires adding `timeoutMs?: number` to `UpstreamConfig` in `src/proxy/types.ts`.

**Step 2:** Set a timeout on the request in `forward()`. After `upstreamReq` is created (line 84), add a timeout handler:

```typescript
const upstreamReq = requestFn(
  this.url,
  {
    method: req.method ?? 'POST',
    headers,
    timeout: this.timeoutMs,
  },
  (upstreamRes) => {
    // ... existing response handler
  },
);

upstreamReq.on('timeout', () => {
  upstreamReq.destroy(new Error(`Upstream "${this.name}" timed out after ${this.timeoutMs}ms`));
});
```

The `timeout` option on `http.request()` sets the socket timeout. When it fires, we destroy the request which triggers the existing `upstreamReq.on('error', ...)` handler (line 166), which already returns a 502 to the client.

This is safe because:
- The `timeout` option in Node's `http.request` sets `socket.setTimeout()` after the socket is connected. It fires if no data is received within the timeout window.
- Destroying the request triggers the `'error'` event, which is already handled and sends a 502 to the client.
- SSE streams (which are long-lived) will also timeout if the upstream goes silent for too long. This is intentional — a healthy SSE stream sends periodic heartbeat events.

**Tests to add** (`src/proxy/upstream-http.test.ts`):

1. `forward() returns 502 when upstream times out` — create a test HTTP server that never responds, set `timeoutMs: 500`, verify that `forward()` resolves with `statusCode: 502` within ~1s.
2. `default timeout is 30 seconds` — construct HttpUpstream without `timeoutMs`, verify the field defaults to 30000.

---

### ✅ Fix #7: Handle incomplete response on upstream error mid-stream

**File:** `src/proxy/upstream-http.ts`

In the non-SSE response handler (lines 136-162), if the upstream errors after `res.writeHead()` has been called (line 100) and some data chunks have arrived, the error handler calls `res.end()` (line 154) which sends a clean end-of-response signal. The client receives a truncated but syntactically valid HTTP response, which it may try to parse as valid JSON-RPC.

For SSE streams (lines 105-135), the same issue exists: `res.end()` is called on `ByteCountTransform` error, which sends a clean close rather than an error signal.

**Non-SSE fix** (lines 152-161): Instead of calling `res.end()`, destroy the socket to force the client to recognize an error:

Replace:

```typescript
upstreamRes.on('error', (err) => {
  logger.error('Upstream response error', { error: String(err) });
  if (!res.writableEnded) res.end();
  resolve({
    statusCode,
    isStreaming: false,
    responseSizeBytes: 0,
    upstreamLatencyMs,
  });
});
```

With:

```typescript
upstreamRes.on('error', (err) => {
  logger.error('Upstream response error', { error: String(err) });
  const bytesAlreadySent = chunks.reduce((sum, c) => sum + c.length, 0);
  if (bytesAlreadySent > 0 && !res.writableEnded) {
    // Data was already piped — clean end() would produce a truncated response
    // the client might try to parse. Destroy the socket to signal the error.
    res.socket?.destroy();
  } else if (!res.writableEnded) {
    res.end();
  }
  resolve({
    statusCode,
    isStreaming: false,
    responseSizeBytes: bytesAlreadySent,
    upstreamLatencyMs,
  });
});
```

**SSE fix** (lines 109-111): The existing `ByteCountTransform` error handler already calls `res.end()`. Since SSE clients typically reconnect on error anyway, this is less critical, but for consistency:

Replace:

```typescript
counter.on('error', (err) => {
  logger.error('Stream error in ByteCountTransform', { error: String(err) });
  if (!res.writableEnded) res.end();
});
```

With:

```typescript
counter.on('error', (err) => {
  logger.error('Stream error in ByteCountTransform', { error: String(err) });
  if (!res.writableEnded) {
    res.socket?.destroy();
  }
});
```

Also fix the `responseSizeBytes: 0` in the non-SSE error (line 158) — the metric should reflect actual bytes sent, not 0:

The updated code above already passes `bytesAlreadySent` instead of `0`.

**Tests to add** (`src/proxy/upstream-http.test.ts`):

1. `forward() destroys socket when upstream errors after partial data` — create a test server that sends headers + partial body then destroys the connection. Verify the client socket is destroyed (not a clean `end()`).
2. `forward() records actual bytes sent on mid-stream error` — same setup, verify `responseSizeBytes` is non-zero.

### ✅ Fix #8: Apply `since` and `developer` filters in cost_per_outcome handler

**File:** `src/tools/cross-session-tools.ts`

The `handleGetCostPerOutcome` handler (lines 363-385) accepts `since` and `developer` parameters but passes all completed tasks from `taskDetector.getCompletedTasks()` directly to `attributeCosts()` without filtering. The parameters are declared in the tool's `inputSchema` (lines 129-136) and parsed from args (lines 319-322), but never applied.

Note: `AiCodingTask` has `startTime` (epoch ms) but no `developer` field. Filtering by developer is not possible at the task level with the current data model. However, filtering by `since` timestamp IS possible.

**Change:** Filter tasks by `since` before passing to `attributeCosts()`:

Replace lines 368-370:

```typescript
const tasks = taskDetector.getCompletedTasks();

const attribution = costPerOutcomeAnalyzer.attributeCosts(tasks);
```

With:

```typescript
let tasks = taskDetector.getCompletedTasks();

// Also include the active task
const current = taskDetector.getCurrentTask();
if (current) {
  tasks = [...tasks, current];
}

// Filter by time range
if (args.since) {
  const sinceMs = new Date(args.since).getTime();
  if (!isNaN(sinceMs)) {
    tasks = tasks.filter((t) => t.startTime >= sinceMs);
  }
}

const attribution = costPerOutcomeAnalyzer.attributeCosts(tasks);
```

For the `developer` parameter: since `AiCodingTask` does not carry a developer field, we should either:
- (a) Remove the `developer` property from the tool's `inputSchema`, or
- (b) Add a `developer` field to `AiCodingTask` for future use.

For now, option (a) is safer — remove the `developer` property from `COST_PER_OUTCOME_TOOL`'s `inputSchema` (lines 133-135 in cross-session-tools.ts) to avoid advertising a filter that can't work:

```typescript
// Remove this from the inputSchema.properties:
developer: {
  type: 'string',
  description: 'Filter by developer name',
},
```

**Tests to add** (`src/tools/cross-session-tools.test.ts`):

1. `handleGetCostPerOutcome filters tasks by since parameter` — create tasks with different timestamps, pass `since` date that excludes older tasks, verify output only reflects recent tasks.
2. `handleGetCostPerOutcome includes active task` — set up a TaskDetector with only an active task (no completed), verify output includes that task's cost data.
3. `handleGetCostPerOutcome handles invalid since date gracefully` — pass `since: "not-a-date"`, verify it returns all tasks rather than crashing.

### ✅ Fix #9: Guard session gauge timer against firing after stop

**File:** `src/transport/nr-ingest.ts`

The session gauge interval (lines 307-310) fires on the metric harvest cadence with `.unref()` so it doesn't keep the process alive. However, there's a race: the interval callback can fire between `stop()` being called and `clearInterval()` executing. The `stop()` method at line 313 does clear the interval, but the callback may already be in the event loop queue.

More concretely: `stop()` calls `clearInterval()` (line 316) then `emitSessionGauges()` (line 321) as a final emission. If the timer fires between these two calls (unlikely but possible under event loop pressure), `emitSessionGauges()` runs on a partially stopped scheduler.

**Fix:** Add a `running` flag and guard the callback.

Add a class field:

```typescript
private running = false;
```

In `start()` (line 302), set it:

```typescript
start(): void {
  this.running = true;
  this.scheduler.start();
  this.logIngest.start();
  // ...
}
```

In `stop()` (line 313), clear it first:

```typescript
async stop(): Promise<void> {
  this.running = false;
  // Clear session gauge interval
  if (this.sessionGaugeIntervalId !== null) {
    clearInterval(this.sessionGaugeIntervalId);
    this.sessionGaugeIntervalId = null;
  }
  // ...
}
```

Guard `emitSessionGauges()` (line 326):

```typescript
private emitSessionGauges(): void {
  if (!this.running) return;
  // ... rest unchanged
}
```

Wait — `stop()` calls `emitSessionGauges()` at line 321 as a final emission. With the guard, that final call would be skipped since `running` is already false. Fix: call `emitSessionGauges()` before setting `running = false`, or inline the final emission.

Revised `stop()`:

```typescript
async stop(): Promise<void> {
  // Clear session gauge interval
  if (this.sessionGaugeIntervalId !== null) {
    clearInterval(this.sessionGaugeIntervalId);
    this.sessionGaugeIntervalId = null;
  }

  // Emit final session gauges before marking as stopped
  this.emitSessionGauges();

  this.running = false;

  await Promise.all([this.scheduler.stop(), this.logIngest.stop()]);
}
```

This ensures:
- The guard prevents the interval callback from firing after `running = false`.
- The explicit final emission in `stop()` still runs because `running` is still `true` at that point.
- After `this.running = false`, any queued interval callbacks are no-ops.

**Tests to add** (`src/transport/nr-ingest.test.ts`):

1. `emitSessionGauges is a no-op after stop()` — call `stop()`, then manually invoke `emitSessionGauges()` (via the interval's callback), verify no metrics are recorded to the scheduler.
2. `stop() emits final session gauges before stopping` — spy on `emitSessionGauges`, call `stop()`, verify it was called exactly once during shutdown.

### ✅ Fix #10: Use consistent neutral fallback for autonomy when no data exists

**File:** `src/metrics/collaboration-profile.ts`

The `computeAutonomy()` function (lines 222-225) returns `0.8` when `userMessages === 0`, implying high autonomy. But zero messages means "no data," not "the agent was highly autonomous." Other fallback functions in the same file use more appropriate defaults:
- `computeSpecificity()` (line 213): returns `0.5` (neutral) when `userMessages === 0`
- `computeCorrectionRate()` (line 232): returns `1.0` (no corrections) when `userMessages === 0`

The doc comment on line 220 even says "falls back to 0.8 (assumed autonomous)" — the assumption is unjustified.

**Fix:** Change the fallback from `0.8` to `0.5`:

Replace line 223:

```typescript
if (userMessages === 0) return 0.8;
```

With:

```typescript
if (userMessages === 0) return 0.5;
```

Update the doc comment on line 220 from:

```typescript
 * When userMessages is 0, falls back to 0.8 (assumed autonomous).
```

To:

```typescript
 * When userMessages is 0, falls back to 0.5 (neutral — insufficient data).
```

This is safe because:
- 0.5 is the semantic midpoint of the 0-1 range, meaning "unknown."
- It matches the pattern used by `computeSpecificity()`.
- It prevents short/automated sessions from inflating team autonomy baselines.
- The team recommendation engine (line 140 in recommendation-engine.ts) checks `baseline.dimensions.autonomy < 0.5`, so a 0.5 neutral value won't falsely trigger "low team autonomy" recommendations.

**Tests to update** (`src/metrics/collaboration-profile.test.ts`):

1. Update any test asserting autonomy is `0.8` for zero-message sessions to expect `0.5` instead.
2. Add test: `computeProfile returns 0.5 autonomy for sessions with zero user messages` — save a session with `userMessages: 0`, compute profile, verify `dimensions.autonomy === 0.5`.

---

### ✅ Fix #11: Safe destructuring of pipe-delimited metric keys

**File:** `src/metrics/proxy-metrics.ts`

Lines 197-198 and 240-241 destructure `key.split('|')` with non-null assertions (`!`):

```typescript
const [tool, server] = key.split('|');
toolPopularity.push({ tool: tool!, server: server!, count });
```

If a malformed key somehow lacks a `|`, `server` is `undefined` (cast away by `!`), producing metric attributes with `undefined` values. While keys are internally constructed and should always contain `|`, defensive code is cheap here.

**Fix:** Add a fallback for both destructured values. Replace both occurrences (lines 197-198 and 240-241):

At line 197-198:

```typescript
const [tool = 'unknown', server = 'unknown'] = key.split('|');
toolPopularity.push({ tool, server, count });
```

At line 240-241:

```typescript
const [tool = 'unknown', server = 'unknown'] = key.split('|');
aggregator.record('ai.mcp.tool_popularity', count, { tool, server });
```

This removes the need for `!` assertions and produces valid (if unexpected) attributes instead of `undefined`. No new tests needed — this is a defensive coding improvement against a practically impossible scenario.

---

### ✅ Fix #12: Add runtime validation for feedback quality enum

**File:** `src/tools/workflow-tools.ts`

The `handleReportFeedback` function (lines 290-298) accepts a `quality` field typed as `'good' | 'bad' | 'neutral'` but performs no runtime validation. MCP schema validation _usually_ catches invalid values, but if a client bypasses schema validation or the schema is misconfigured, invalid values are stored as-is into the feedback record.

**Fix:** Add a runtime check at the top of the handler:

Replace lines 290-298:

```typescript
export function handleReportFeedback(
  feedbackCollector: FeedbackCollector,
  args: { quality: 'good' | 'bad' | 'neutral'; notes?: string; task_id?: string },
) {
  const record = feedbackCollector.record({
    quality: args.quality,
    notes: args.notes,
    taskId: args.task_id,
  });
```

With:

```typescript
const VALID_QUALITY_VALUES = new Set(['good', 'bad', 'neutral']);

export function handleReportFeedback(
  feedbackCollector: FeedbackCollector,
  args: { quality: 'good' | 'bad' | 'neutral'; notes?: string; task_id?: string },
) {
  if (!VALID_QUALITY_VALUES.has(args.quality)) {
    return {
      content: [{
        type: 'text' as const,
        text: JSON.stringify({
          error: `Invalid quality value: "${args.quality}". Must be one of: good, bad, neutral`,
        }),
      }],
      isError: true,
    };
  }

  const record = feedbackCollector.record({
    quality: args.quality,
    notes: args.notes,
    taskId: args.task_id,
  });
```

This is a lightweight guard that:
- Returns a clear error message with `isError: true` so MCP clients can distinguish it from success.
- Prevents invalid data from reaching the feedback store.
- Has zero cost for valid inputs (a Set lookup).

**Tests to add** (`src/tools/workflow-tools.test.ts`):

1. `handleReportFeedback rejects invalid quality values` — call with `quality: 'excellent'`, verify `isError: true` in response.
2. `handleReportFeedback accepts all valid quality values` — call with each of `'good'`, `'bad'`, `'neutral'`, verify each returns `recorded: true`.

## Critical / High Severity

### ✅ 13. Data loss in HarvestScheduler on send failure (shared package)

**File:** `packages/shared/src/harvest/harvest-scheduler.ts:127-167`

The `harvestEvents()` method calls `this.eventBuffer.flush()` which atomically drains the buffer and returns the batch. If `sendEventsFn()` then fails (returns `{ success: false }` or throws), the batch is logged as "dropped" and permanently lost. The identical pattern exists in `harvestMetrics()` with `this.metricAggregator.harvest()`.

This is the same data-loss pattern as Round 1 bug #1, which was found and fixed in `packages/nr-ai-mcp-server/src/transport/log-ingest.ts`. The shared `HarvestScheduler` was **not** fixed — it has the identical vulnerability.

```typescript
const batch = this.eventBuffer.flush();  // ← buffer drained
const result = await this.sendEventsFn(batch, ...);
if (!result.success) {
  logger.warn('Failed to send events — batch dropped', { droppedCount: batch.length });
  // batch is gone forever
}
```

**Impact:** On any transient network failure or NR API outage, an entire harvest cycle's worth of `AiToolCall` events AND metric data are silently dropped. The `sendWithRetry` in `http-client.ts` does retry on 408/429/5xx, but if all retries fail, the batch is permanently lost. This is the primary data pipeline — all events and metrics flow through this class.

**Fix:** Same approach as the Round 1 log-ingest fix — re-queue the batch on failure with a cap to prevent unbounded growth. Apply to both `harvestEvents()` and `harvestMetrics()`.

---

### ✅ 14. SSE upstream connection leaks when client disconnects

**File:** `packages/nr-ai-mcp-server/src/proxy/upstream-http.ts:108-140`

In the SSE streaming path, `upstreamRes.pipe(counter).pipe(res)` sets up a pipe chain. There is no handler for client disconnection (`res.on('close', ...)` is never registered). When the client closes the connection:

1. `res` becomes a destroyed writable stream
2. `counter` tries to write to the destroyed `res`, gets an error
3. The `counter.on('error')` handler fires and destroys `res.socket` (already destroyed)
4. But `upstreamRes` (the upstream HTTP connection) is never destroyed or unpiped
5. The `forward()` promise waits for `upstreamRes.on('end')` or `upstreamRes.on('error')`, neither of which fires because the upstream is still sending data

The `forward()` promise never resolves, and the upstream connection stays open until the upstream server closes it (which for SSE could be hours or never).

**Impact:** Each client disconnect during SSE streaming leaks one upstream HTTP connection. Over time, this accumulates open sockets and unresolved promises. For long-running proxy instances, this leads to resource exhaustion.

**Fix:** Add a `res.on('close', ...)` handler that destroys the upstream connection and resolves the promise:

```typescript
res.on('close', () => {
  if (!upstreamRes.destroyed) {
    upstreamRes.destroy();
  }
  resolve({
    statusCode,
    isStreaming: true,
    responseSizeBytes: counter.bytes,
    upstreamLatencyMs,
  });
});
```

---

## Medium Severity

### ✅ 15. `autonomy` and `correctionRate` use identical formula — `Collaborative` classification unreachable

**File:** `src/metrics/collaboration-profile.ts:222-234, 265-272`

`computeAutonomy(corrections, userMessages)` computes `1 - corrections / userMessages`. `computeCorrectionRate(corrections, userMessages)` computes `1 - corrections / userMessages`. Both receive the same inputs (`totalUserCorrections, totalUserMessages`) from `computeDimensions` at lines 202-203. Therefore `autonomy === correctionRate` always when `userMessages > 0`.

In `classify()` (line 265-272):
- Case 2 (`Delegator`): `specificity < 0.6 && autonomy >= 0.6`
- Case 3 (`Learning`): `specificity < 0.6 && correctionRate < 0.6`
- Case 4 (`Collaborative`): default/else

Since `autonomy === correctionRate`, once case 2 fails (autonomy < 0.6), case 3's `correctionRate < 0.6` is always true. The `Collaborative` classification is unreachable.

**Impact:** Developers who should be classified as `Collaborative` are classified as `Learning`. This affects the collaboration profile output and NR events. The `autonomy` dimension was likely intended to measure something different from correction rate (e.g., ratio of questions asked to tool calls).

**Fix:** Redesign `computeAutonomy` to measure a distinct dimension — e.g., based on `askedUserQuestions / toolCalls` (as done in `efficiency-score.ts:194-197`) rather than the correction ratio.

---

### ✅ 16. `reportCount` double-counts estimations in CostTracker

**File:** `src/metrics/cost-tracker.ts:81-93`

`recordEstimatedTokens()` increments `this.estimationCount` (line 91), then delegates to `this.recordTokenUsage()` (line 92), which increments `this.reportCount` (line 71). After N estimation calls: `reportCount = N` and `estimationCount = N`, suggesting N direct reports AND N estimations (2N total) when there were only N estimations.

**Impact:** The `reportCount` and `estimationCount` fields in cost metrics (exposed via `nr_observe_get_cost_breakdown`) are misleading. The `ai.cost.report_count` metric emitted to NR is inflated.

**Fix:** Don't increment `reportCount` in `recordTokenUsage` when called from `recordEstimatedTokens`, or change `reportCount` to mean "total reports including estimations" and document it accordingly.

---

### ✅ 17. `contextTokensForClaudeMd` severely underestimates token count for modifications

**File:** `src/metrics/claudemd-tracker.ts:232-239`

The context token estimate uses `latestChange.linesAdded * 40 * TOKENS_PER_CHAR` (i.e., `linesAdded * 10`). The `linesAdded` value represents lines added in that specific edit, not the total file size. For a modification that adds 3 lines to a 500-line CLAUDE.md, this estimates ~30 tokens when the actual context cost is the entire file (~5000 tokens).

The class already has a correct `estimateContextCost()` static method (line 262-276) that reads the actual file and computes tokens from total character count, but `computeImpact()` doesn't use it.

**Impact:** The `contextTokensForClaudeMd` field is wildly inaccurate (1-2 orders of magnitude low). The recommendation engine's "Large CLAUDE.md context cost" recommendation (3000-token threshold in `recommendation-engine.ts:291-299`) almost never triggers.

**Fix:** Use `estimateContextCost()` or read the file's total size instead of `linesAdded`.

---

### ✅ 18. `flagged` map cleared/deleted too aggressively in blind editing detection

**File:** `src/metrics/anti-patterns.ts:250-259`

Two related bugs in `detectBlindEditing()`:

**Bug A (line 251):** When a `Read` is detected for a file, `flagged.delete(file)` removes an already-confirmed detection. If file A was edited 5+ times (exceeding threshold, added to `flagged`), then a Read of file A occurs later, the confirmed pattern is erased. Only `editStreaks.delete(file)` (resetting the streak counter) is correct here.

**Bug B (line 259):** When a successful verification command runs, `flagged.clear()` wipes ALL already-detected patterns. Consider: Edit A 5 times (flagged), Edit B 5 times (flagged), then run a passing test — both detections are lost, function returns zero patterns.

The `flagged` map should accumulate final results and never be cleared. Only `editStreaks` should be reset.

**Impact:** False negatives in blind editing detection. Anti-pattern counts are understated, giving users an overly optimistic view of editing habits.

**Fix:** Remove `flagged.delete(file)` on Read (line 251) and `flagged.clear()` on verification (line 259). Only clear/delete from `editStreaks`.

---

### ✅ 19. `.count` and `.sum` metrics emitted as `gauge` type instead of `count`

**File:** `packages/shared/src/harvest/metric-aggregator.ts:59-70`

The `harvest()` method emits all sub-metrics (`.count`, `.sum`, `.min`, `.max`) with `type: 'gauge'`. The `.count` and `.sum` sub-metrics are cumulative within an aggregation interval and should be `type: 'count'` for correct interpretation by the NR Metric API. Gauges represent point-in-time values — NR will average/latest them instead of summing across intervals.

**Impact:** NRQL queries like `FROM Metric SELECT sum(ai.request.duration.count)` over time windows will not aggregate correctly. Rate calculations (`rate(sum(...), 1 minute)`) also produce incorrect results. The `.min` and `.max` sub-metrics ARE correctly typed as gauges.

**Fix:** Use `type: 'count'` for the `.count` and `.sum` metrics:

```typescript
metrics.push({ ...base, type: 'count', name: `${bucket.name}.count`, value: bucket.count });
metrics.push({ ...base, type: 'count', name: `${bucket.name}.sum`, value: bucket.sum });
metrics.push({ ...base, name: `${bucket.name}.min`, value: bucket.min });
metrics.push({ ...base, name: `${bucket.name}.max`, value: bucket.max });
```

---

### ✅ 20. Invalid `since` date throws unhandled `RangeError` in session history

**File:** `src/tools/cross-session-tools.ts:201`

`handleGetSessionHistory` creates a `Date` from the user-provided `since` string without validation. `new Date("not-a-date")` produces an Invalid Date, which propagates to `sessionStore.loadAllSessions()` → `formatDate()` → `date.toISOString()`, which throws `RangeError: Invalid time value`.

Note: `handleGetCostPerOutcome` (line 372) correctly handles this case with `isNaN(sinceMs)` — this handler was missed.

**Impact:** Confusing opaque error message instead of a clear "invalid date" response. Does not crash the server (MCP SDK catches it).

**Fix:** Validate the date before use:

```typescript
const since = args.since ? new Date(args.since) : undefined;
if (since && isNaN(since.getTime())) {
  return { content: [{ type: 'text', text: JSON.stringify({ error: 'Invalid since date' }) }], isError: true };
}
```

---

### ✅ 21. `by_model` cost breakdown attributes ALL session costs to the last-used model

**File:** `src/tools/cost-tools.ts:118-121`

`handleGetCostBreakdown` builds a `byModel` object by assigning the **entire** `sessionTotalCostUsd` to `metrics.model` (the most recently used model). If a user switches models during a session (e.g., Sonnet for some work, Opus for other work), `by_model` will have a single entry attributing all costs to the last model.

```typescript
const byModel: Record<string, number> = {};
if (metrics.model && metrics.sessionTotalCostUsd !== null) {
  byModel[metrics.model] = metrics.sessionTotalCostUsd;  // ← all costs to last model
}
```

**Impact:** Wrong cost attribution data. Users comparing model costs get incorrect numbers. The `total_usd` field is correct; only the `by_model` breakdown is wrong.

**Fix:** Track per-model cost accumulation in `CostTracker` (e.g., a `Map<string, number>` incremented in `recordTokenUsage`), and expose it in `getMetrics()`.

---

### ✅ 22. Active task efficiency score permanently stale after first query

**File:** `src/tools/workflow-tools.ts:249-260`

`handleGetEfficiencyScore` scores unscored tasks by checking `scoredIds.has(task.taskId)`. The first time this tool is called while a task is active, the active task gets scored and its `taskId` added to `scoredIds`. On subsequent calls, the same `taskId` is already in `scoredIds` — it's skipped even though the task now has more tool calls and different metrics.

**Impact:** If a user calls `nr_observe_get_efficiency_score` early in a task (e.g., after 5 tool calls), the score is locked in. Calling it again after 50 more tool calls returns the same stale score. The `session_average` is also affected.

**Fix:** For active tasks, always recompute the score (replace the stale entry). Only use `scoredIds` caching for completed/immutable tasks.

---

### ✅ 23. `parseToolSpecificFields` ignores `output` parameter — Bash `exitCode` never extracted

**File:** `src/hooks/tool-parsers.ts:154-172`

`parseToolSpecificFields(toolName, input, output)` accepts an `output` parameter but never uses it. The function body only runs `INPUT_PARSERS[toolName]` — there are no output parsers. For Bash commands, the `tool_response` from Claude Code's hook contains the exit code, but since the output is never parsed, the `exitCode` field is never set on `ToolCallRecord`.

**Impact:** This makes the Round 1 fix #3 (populate `bashExitCodes` in `session-tracker.ts`) a **no-op** — the reading code is there but no data ever arrives through the hook pipeline. The `bashExitCodes` map remains empty in production. The workflow trace also never shows exit codes.

**Fix:** Add an `OUTPUT_PARSERS` map with a Bash output parser that extracts `exitCode` from the tool response:

```typescript
const OUTPUT_PARSERS: Record<string, (output: Record<string, unknown>) => ToolFields> = {
  Bash: (output) => {
    const fields: ToolFields = {};
    if (typeof output.exitCode === 'number') {
      fields.exitCode = output.exitCode;
    }
    return fields;
  },
};
```

And call it in `parseToolSpecificFields`:

```typescript
const outputParser = OUTPUT_PARSERS[toolName];
if (outputParser && output !== null && output !== undefined && typeof output === 'object') {
  Object.assign(fields, outputParser(output as Record<string, unknown>));
}
```

---

### ✅ 24. `config.enabled` is read but never checked — disable toggle non-functional

**Files:** `src/config.ts:152-153`, `src/index.ts`

`config.enabled` is loaded from the `NEW_RELIC_AI_MCP_ENABLED` env var (line 153) and stored in the frozen config object. It's even logged in debug output. But no code path in `index.ts` or anywhere else ever checks `config.enabled`. The server starts, registers hooks, ingests events, and sends data to NR regardless.

**Impact:** Users who set `NEW_RELIC_AI_MCP_ENABLED=false` expecting to disable the server find it running normally. The documented configuration option is non-functional.

**Fix:** Add an early exit in `main()` in `index.ts`:

```typescript
if (!config.enabled) {
  logger.info('Server disabled via config — exiting');
  process.exit(0);
}
```

---

### ✅ 25. Concurrent shutdown calls can cause incomplete final event flush

**File:** `src/index.ts:182-196`

The `shutdown` function is registered with `process.on('SIGINT', shutdown)`, `process.on('SIGTERM', shutdown)`, AND `process.stdin.on('end', ...)`. All three use `process.on` (not `once`), so:

1. The same signal can trigger `shutdown` twice (SIGINT sent twice rapidly)
2. `stdin` closing and a signal can arrive simultaneously (common when the parent process dies)
3. The `stdin.on('end')` callback calls `shutdown()` without `await`, so the promise floats

When two concurrent `shutdown()` calls race, both call `await nrIngest.stop()` then `process.exit(0)`. The first call to reach `process.exit(0)` kills the process before the other call's final flush completes.

**Impact:** The final event batch and metric harvest may be dropped on shutdown. The window is small but the scenario (stdin close + SIGTERM) is common when Claude Code terminates.

**Fix:** Add a guard:

```typescript
let shuttingDown = false;
const shutdown = async () => {
  if (shuttingDown) return;
  shuttingDown = true;
  // ... rest of shutdown
};
```

---

### ✅ 26. Default case in `dispatchToClient` always fails with TypeError

**File:** `src/proxy/upstream-stdio.ts:209-214`

The `default` case calls `client.request()` with `{} as Parameters<typeof client.request>[1]` as the result schema. At runtime, the MCP SDK calls `safeParse({}, response.result)`, which tries `{}.safeParse(data)` — since a plain object has no `safeParse` method, this throws `TypeError: v3Schema.safeParse is not a function`.

```typescript
default:
  return client.request(
    { method: rpc.method, params } as Parameters<typeof client.request>[0],
    {} as Parameters<typeof client.request>[1],  // ← always throws TypeError
  );
```

**Impact:** Any MCP method not explicitly handled (e.g., `prompts/list`, `prompts/get`, `completions/complete`, or custom methods) always fails with an opaque error, even if the upstream processes the request successfully. Breaks the proxy's transparent passthrough contract.

**Fix:** Use `z.any()` from Zod as the result schema for unknown methods:

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';
// ...
default:
  return client.request(
    { method: rpc.method, params } as Parameters<typeof client.request>[0],
    z.any(),
  );
```

### ✅ 27. `ProxyManager.start()` hangs forever and crashes on port conflict

**File:** `src/proxy/proxy-manager.ts:120-125`

`start()` wraps `server.listen()` in a `new Promise((resolve) => { ... })` with no `reject` call and no `'error'` event handler on the HTTP server. When `listen()` fails (e.g., `EADDRINUSE`):

1. The callback is never invoked → `resolve()` never called → promise hangs forever
2. The server emits an unhandled `'error'` event → Node.js throws an uncaught exception → process crashes

```typescript
return new Promise((resolve) => {
  this.httpServer!.listen(this.port, '127.0.0.1', () => {
    resolve();   // ← only called on success
  });
  // ← no error handler
});
```

**Impact:** Process crash on port conflict. Easy to trigger when running multiple instances during development.

**Fix:** Add an error handler that rejects the promise:

```typescript
return new Promise<void>((resolve, reject) => {
  this.httpServer!.once('error', reject);
  this.httpServer!.listen(this.port, '127.0.0.1', () => {
    resolve();
  });
});
```

### ✅ 28. `buildSessionSummary` drops the active task's data

**File:** `src/storage/session-store.ts:220-232`

`buildSessionSummary` iterates only `taskMetrics.completedTasks` (line 221) and does not include the currently active task. When a session ends, the last task is typically still active (it hasn't been auto-completed). The active task's files, lines changed, tests run, builds run, and tool calls are all excluded from the summary.

**Impact:** Session summaries systematically undercount metrics for the final task. For short sessions with only one task, the summary shows zero files, zero lines changed, zero tests. This affects weekly summaries, cross-session analytics, and the session history tool.

**Fix:** Include the active task when building the summary:

```typescript
const allTasks = [...taskMetrics.completedTasks];
const activeTasks = taskMetrics.activeTasks ?? [];
allTasks.push(...activeTasks);
for (const task of allTasks) { ... }
```

### ✅ 29. `/token/i` and `/password/i` regex match common source files — false positive alerts

**File:** `src/security/audit-trail.ts:67, 70`

`DEFAULT_SENSITIVE_FILE_PATTERNS` includes `/password/i` (line 67) and `/token/i` (line 70) as bare substring matches without path-boundary anchors. These match any file path containing "password" or "token" anywhere: `src/utils/tokenizer.ts`, `src/auth/PasswordReset.tsx`, `src/services/token-refresh.ts`, etc.

**Impact:** Every Read/Write/Edit of files with "token" or "password" in the path generates a `high` severity security alert. These pollute logs, inflate `securityAlerts` counts, and emit false `SecurityAlert` NR events.

**Fix:** Add path-boundary anchors so these only match files likely to contain credentials:

```typescript
/(?:^|\/)password(?:s)?(?:\.[^/]*)?$/i,  // matches "password.txt", "passwords.json"
/(?:^|\/)token(?:s)?(?:\.[^/]*)?$/i,     // matches "token.json", "tokens.yaml"
```

## Low Severity

### ✅ 30. `sumOfSquares` tracked in MetricAggregator but never emitted

**File:** `packages/shared/src/harvest/metric-aggregator.ts:49, 59-70`

`record()` accumulates `sumOfSquares` (line 49: `bucket.sumOfSquares += value * value`) but `harvest()` never includes it in the output metrics. The `MetricAccumulator` interface exports `sumOfSquares` as a public field, advertising a capability that doesn't reach NR.

**Impact:** Wasted computation on every `record()` call. Any consumer expecting variance/stddev data from NR will find it missing. No current consumer appears to use it.

**Fix:** Either emit it as an additional metric in `harvest()`, or remove the computation and the field from the interface to avoid confusion.

### ✅ 31. HarvestScheduler's own SIGTERM handler races with main shutdown

**Files:** `packages/shared/src/harvest/harvest-scheduler.ts:62-67, 96-97`, `src/index.ts:182-196`

The `HarvestScheduler` constructor creates a `boundSigterm` handler that calls `void this.stop()` (fire-and-forget). It registers this with `process.once('SIGTERM', ...)` at `start()`. Meanwhile, `index.ts` registers its own SIGTERM handler that calls `await nrIngest.stop()` → `await this.scheduler.stop()`.

On SIGTERM:
1. The scheduler's handler fires first and calls `void this.stop()` — sets `this.running = false`
2. The `index.ts` handler calls `await scheduler.stop()` — sees `!this.running` and returns immediately, skipping final flush
3. The first call's fire-and-forget stop may still be in-progress, but `index.ts` proceeds to `process.exit(0)`

**Impact:** Only affects SIGTERM path. The scheduler's handler steals the `running` flag, causing the main shutdown's awaited `stop()` to short-circuit. Final harvest may not complete.

**Fix:** Remove the scheduler's own SIGTERM handler (let the parent manage lifecycle), or make `stop()` idempotent by awaiting the first call's completion.

### ✅ 32. `durationMs` can be negative when system clock adjusts between hook invocations

**File:** `src/hooks/event-processor.ts:176`

Duration is computed as `event.timestamp - preEvent.timestamp`. Both timestamps come from `Date.now()` in separate process invocations (pre-hook and post-hook). If a system clock adjustment (NTP sync, DST, manual change) occurs between them, the post timestamp could be earlier, producing a negative `durationMs`.

**Impact:** Negative durations propagate to NR metrics (`ai.tool.duration_ms`), efficiency score calculations, session stats averages, and anti-pattern detection. Rare in practice but corrupts metrics widely when it occurs.

**Fix:** `Math.max(0, event.timestamp - preEvent.timestamp)`.

## Round 2 Recommendation

**Before sharing (blockers):**
- **#13** (HarvestScheduler data loss) — same class as Round 1 bug #1 but in the primary data pipeline. Every transient network failure drops an entire harvest batch of events and metrics.
- **#23** (output parser missing) — makes the Round 1 fix #3 a no-op. `bashExitCodes` will always be empty.
- **#14** (SSE connection leak) — only applies to proxy mode, but is unbounded resource growth.

**Before production use:**
- **#15** (identical formula), **#16** (double-count), **#17** (token underestimate), **#18** (false negatives), **#21** (wrong by_model), **#22** (stale score) — all produce incorrect data shown to users.
- **#24** (enabled toggle), **#25** (shutdown race), **#26** (stdio default case), **#27** (port crash) — operational issues.
- **#19** (metric type) — affects all NR metric queries using `sum()` or `rate()`.

**Low priority:** #28-32 are real but unlikely to cause visible issues in a demo.
