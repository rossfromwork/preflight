## Why Your AI Tool Needs Observability

Your AI coding assistant makes hundreds of decisions every session — what to read, what to edit, when to run commands. But you can't see any of it. You know it was fast, but was it _efficient_? You got a PR merged, but how much did it cost? You fixed a bug, but did it get stuck in a loop first?

**Preflight is observability for agentic coding** — the actions, cost, and efficiency of your AI coding assistant as it works. See exactly what's happening, how much it costs, and where your AI is wasting time.

**Local-first by design.** Preflight runs entirely on your machine and sends your data nowhere by default. A live dashboard at `localhost:7777` shows your sessions in real time, fully offline. Connect a New Relic account only when you want more — team rollups, alerting, and cross-session history. You choose: **local-only**, **New Relic**, or **both**.

  - **Session Detail** — deep-dive into a single session's tool calls
  - **Team View** — aggregated cost and efficiency across developers
  - **Manager View** — high-level team metrics, no tool-call content
  - **Platform Comparison** — Claude Code vs. Cursor vs. Windsurf, etc.
  - **Security Audit** — audit trail of sensitive file access

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
npm install -g @newrelic/preflight
```

### 2. Run setup

```bash
preflight setup
```

The wizard defaults to **local mode** — press Enter through the prompts and you're set. It wires Preflight into your AI tool (hooks + MCP server) and writes config to `~/.newrelic-preflight/`. Takes under a minute, no account required.

When prompted, pick a mode:

| Mode                  | What it does                                                         | New Relic account? |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **local** _(default)_ | Everything stays on your machine; live dashboard at `localhost:7777` | Not needed         |
| **cloud**             | Ships telemetry to New Relic                                         | Required           |
| **both**              | Local dashboard **and** New Relic                                    | Required           |

### 3. Start coding

Restart your AI tool — hooks and the MCP server load at session start. Every tool call is captured automatically. Open **http://localhost:7777** to watch your session live.

---

## Works With

**Claude Code** • **Cursor** • **Windsurf** • **GitHub Copilot** • **Zed** • **Continue.dev** • **Amazon Q Developer**

> **This fork also supports: Antigravity CLI (`agy`)** — see [Antigravity CLI Setup](#antigravity-cli-agy-setup) below.

---

## Antigravity CLI (`agy`) Setup

This fork adds native support for [Antigravity CLI](https://antigravity.google) alongside
the existing Claude Code integration.

### What's included

- **Hook normalisation** — agy's `toolCall`-based hook payload is translated to Preflight's
  canonical format; all 20 agy tool names map to canonical names (Bash, Read, Write, etc.)
- **`AntigravityAdapter`** — platform adapter stamps all NR events with `platform: 'antigravity'`
- **`AntigravityQuotaPoller`** — connects to the running agy language server to capture quota
  snapshots, estimate token usage from credit deltas, and populate the model usage widget
- **`preflight install --platform antigravity`** — one-command setup

### Quick setup

```bash
# 1. Clone and build this fork
git clone https://github.com/rossfromwork/preflight
cd preflight
git checkout feature/antigravity-gemini-support
npm install && npm run build && npm link

# 2. Wire into Antigravity CLI
preflight install --platform antigravity

# 3. Restart agy — verify inside agy with /hooks and /mcp
```

This writes two files:

- **`~/.gemini/config/hooks.json`** — PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks pointing at `preflight-collector`
- **`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`** — registers `preflight --stdio` as an MCP server

### Configure New Relic (optional)

```bash
preflight setup   # interactive wizard — choose "both" mode for local dashboard + NR
```

Or edit `~/.newrelic-preflight/config.json` directly:

```json
{
  "mode": "both",
  "licenseKey": "YOUR_INGEST_LICENSE_KEY_NRAL",
  "accountId": "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID",
  "developer": "your-name"
}
```

### Run the local dashboard

```bash
preflight --local
# Dashboard at http://localhost:7777
```

The Today page model usage widget shows all available agy models (Gemini, GPT-OSS, Claude)
within ~2 seconds of startup via the quota poller.

### How it works

```
agy (Antigravity CLI)
  │
  ├─ PreToolUse / PostToolUse hooks → preflight-collector
  │    └─> normalises agy toolCall format → writes buffer-<conversationId>.jsonl
  │
  ├─ AntigravityQuotaPoller (every 30s)
  │    └─> calls agy language server GetUserStatus via Connect RPC
  │         └─> quota snapshot → token estimates → model usage widget
  │
  └─ MCP connection (preflight --stdio, spawned by agy)
       └─> computes efficiency scores, task detection, anti-patterns
            └─> saved to ~/.newrelic-preflight/sessions/ on agy exit
```

### Known limitations

| Issue                    | Detail                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Short `--print` sessions | Tool calls may be consumed by `--local` before the MCP heartbeat is written (~4-5s). Interactive `agy` sessions are unaffected. |
| GPT-OSS cost tracking    | GPT-OSS uses a separate quota pool; cost estimates show $0.                                                                     |
| Model widget resets      | In-memory only; repopulates within ~2s when agy is active.                                                                      |

## Connect New Relic (optional)

Local mode is fully featured on its own. Connect a New Relic account to unlock:

- **Team & manager dashboards** across multiple developers
- **Alerting** on cost spikes, low efficiency, and stuck loops
- **Cross-session history**, trends, and weekly coaching reports

Re-run `preflight setup` and choose **cloud** or **both**, or configure it non-interactively:

```bash
preflight install \
  --mode cloud \
  --license-key YOUR_LICENSE_KEY \
  --account-id YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID
```

EU accounts add `--eu`. FedRAMP accounts add `--fedramp`.

Then deploy the prebuilt dashboards:

```bash
NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=NRAK-... NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=12345 \
  preflight deploy-dashboards --all
```

You'll need a **license key** (telemetry ingest) and your **account ID**, plus a **user API key** (`NRAK-…`) to deploy dashboards and alerts. See [ADVANCED.md](docs/ADVANCED.md) for alerts, OTLP export to other backends, and Terraform.

> **Data ingest note:** Telemetry sent to New Relic counts against your account's data ingest. On paid plans, standard ingest rates apply. Monitor your usage under **NR One → Data Management → Data Ingestion**.

---

## Requirements

### Required

- **Node.js v22 or higher** ([get it](https://nodejs.org) or use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- **An AI coding tool** (Claude Code recommended for deepest integration)

### Optional

- **New Relic account** — only for `cloud`/`both` mode. Skip it to run local-only (the default).
- **User API key** (`NRAK-…`) — only needed to deploy dashboards and alerts

---

## Other Commands

```bash
preflight validate    # Check config for syntax errors and unknown keys
preflight update      # Pull latest version and rebuild
preflight uninstall   # Remove hooks and MCP config from your AI tool
```

Add `--project` to `install`/`uninstall` to scope changes to the current directory only.

**WSL users:** `preflight setup` will ask which Claude Code you're running. You can also set it explicitly:

- `--windows-cc` — Windows Claude Code (the desktop app); uses `wsl.exe` hooks and Windows paths
- `--linux-cc` — Linux Claude Code installed via npm inside WSL
